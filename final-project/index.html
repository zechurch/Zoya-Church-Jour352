                        MANCHESTER, ENGLAND -- "My money is in this pot and I'm not here to make more -- I just want to
                        win." As a statement of intent, Sir Jim Ratcliffe had turned night into day at Manchester United
                        by telling club staff why he has decided to spend £1.3 billion for a 25% stake in the team.
                        <br /><br />
                        It is early January and Ratcliffe, alongside Sir Dave Brailsford (former performance director of
                        British Cycling and director of sport at Ratcliffe's INEOS Group), is addressing over 100 United
                        staff -- ticket office and administration staff, security officers, canteen workers -- in one of
                        Old Trafford's vast conference suites. Others are dialing in remotely to watch on video as the
                        incoming minority shareholder offers his vision of United's future.

                        <br /><br />

                        "Everyone left the room feeling 10-foot tall," a United staff member who attended Ratcliffe's
                        introductory speech told ESPN. "All we have heard for years has been about cutbacks and
                        engagement targets, so to hear somebody tell us that we are going to be a football club again
                        was long overdue and a refreshing change. It was also nice to be in the same room as the person
                        in charge. That has never happened with the Glazers."

                        <br /><br />

                        Ratcliffe's determination to speak to the club's team behind the scenes was welcomed by another
                        United employee in the room.

                        <br /><br />

                        "Sir Jim said that we were as important to the club's success as the players," the employee told
                        ESPN. "He said that the club couldn't move forward and succeed without us all working together,
                        as one, and that we were all part of the same team with the sole objective of making everything
                        better."

                        <br /><br />
                        Ratcliffe's net worth was estimated at £29.7bn by the 2023 Sunday Times Rich List. He's now the
                        second-richest person in the UK according to that list, behind India-born businessman Gopi
                        Hinduja. Ratcliffe will take charge of football operations from United's owners, the Glazer
                        family, when his investment is ratified by the Premier League in early February. Having made his
                        fortune by building INEOS, the petrochemicals company, Ratcliffe, 71, wants to use his wealth
                        and business expertise to help revive the club he supported as a boy, growing up in the
                        blue-collar Manchester suburb of Failsworth.

                    </blockquote>

                    <br />
                    <p>
                        For many who work at United, Ratcliffe's arrival can't come soon enough. The club has been under
                        the control of the Glazers, who also own the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers, since a leveraged
                        buyout in May 2005 that plunged United into more than £500m worth of debt.
                        <br /><br />
                        Even before the Glazers bought United, they encountered hostility from the club's supporters who
                        were angered by the prospect of the team, previously debt-free and incredibly successful, being
                        forced into a huge level of debt. A vehicle carrying the Glazers was attacked by fans on their
                        first visit to Old Trafford and the anger has never subsided. In 2010, United fans launched
                        their "green-and-gold" campaign -- green and gold were the colours of Newton Heath, the club
                        which later changed its name to Manchester United -- as a visible protest against the Glazers,
                        with former player David Beckham putting a green-and-gold scarf around his neck while returning
                        to Old Trafford with AC Milan that year.
                        <br /><br />
                        Walk past any lamp-post or building near Old Trafford and you will see faded stickers, dating
                        back to 2005, which simply say, "Love United Hate Glazer." The antipathy toward the Glazers was
                        played out to a global television audience in May 2021 when fans forced the postponement of a
                        Premier League game against Liverpool at Old Trafford. A protest outside the stadium at the
                        Glazers' involvement in plans to form a breakaway European Super League spilled over when
                        supporters forced their way onto the pitch.
                        <br /><br />
                        For almost two decades, the Premier League's biggest and most successful club has had to service
                        the Glazer debt at the same time as paying regular dividends to the family. Over the past five
                        years, no other Premier League club paid a dividend to its owners. In 2023, the Glazers opted
                        against taking a dividend for the first time to use the funds for new signings.
                        <br /><br />
                        By 2015, 10 years after the takeover, the cost to United of being owned by the Glazers exceeded
                        £1bn in interest payments, financing costs and dividends for the six siblings in director roles
                        at the club.

                        In contrast to United supporters, the Bucs fanbase in Tampa likes the Glazers. A source familiar
                        with the Glazer regime at the NFL club said that the family "brought hope" when buying the
                        franchise in 1995, ousting an unpopular owner and investing in a new stadium and the team before
                        building a new training centre. In 2016, the Glazers began a three-phase renovation of Raymond
                        James Stadium, including new giant videoboards, suites and a bigger locker room, in order to
                        host Super Bowl LV in 2021, which the Bucs won in no small part to the Glazers recruiting
                        legendary quarterback Tom Brady. Off the field, the Glazers -- notably Darcie Glazer Kassewitz
                        -- attend functions and host social and charity events, but in Manchester, they have remained
                        largely invisible for almost 20 years.
                        <br /><br />
                        Ownership under the Glazers has seen United overtaken, on and off the pitch, by rivals Liverpool
                        and Manchester City, with both the team and stadium at Old Trafford requiring extensive -- and
                        expensive -- improvement and modernization. The decline of the team speaks for itself, with no
                        Premier League titles, or even a sustained challenge, since 2013. In that time, City have won
                        six titles and a Champions League, while Liverpool have won the league and Champions League.
                        <br /><br />
                        Having been England's biggest and most modern stadium in the early-2000s, Old Trafford has been
                        practically untouched by the Glazers since work to extend the capacity, started before their
                        arrival in 2005, was completed shortly after the takeover. Opposition fans now taunt home fans
                        by singing "Old Trafford is falling down" on visits to United. The roof of the Main Stand leaks
                        when it rains and the stadium has been left off the list of venues for Euro 2028, which will be
                        hosted by the United Kingdom and Ireland. In April 2022, United enlisted stadium architects
                        Populous, who designed the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and Qatar's Lusail Stadium, venue of the
                        2022 World Cup final, and designers Legends International to "create a masterplan for the
                        redevelopment of Old Trafford." Two years later, Populous' blueprint is yet to be realized.
                        <br /><br />
                        Former United captain Gary Neville, speaking in April 2023, called the Glazers' maintenance of
                        Old Trafford "shameful."
                        <br /><br />
                        "They have overseen a decline for 20 years in which it has gone from being one of the best
                        stadiums in the world to one that can't even get into the top 10 in the UK and Ireland," Neville
                        told Sky Sports. "This is an all-time low. There has been no investment. It is a rusty stadium.
                        This is a dereliction of duty."
                        <br /><br />
                        Since 2016, Liverpool have spent £195m on two new stands at Anfield, raising the capacity by
                        over 15,000, while Manchester City opened a new £200m training ground in 2014 and are committed
                        to a further £300m investment in the stadium -- built for Manchester's hosting of the
                        Commonwealth Games in 2002 -- between now and 2026. As part of Ratcliffe's investment, he has
                        committed £250m for the upgrade of Old Trafford and the club's Carrington training ground, which
                        opened in 2000.

                        "Sir Jim and his team were really positive when they spoke to us," another staff member told
                        ESPN. "Without saying it directly, they were saying, 'We know it's a bit s---, but we can make
                        it better if we all work together.' It was inspiring to listen to." <br /><br />
                        Ratcliffe already has made a bold start, raiding Manchester City for chief operating officer
                        Omar Berrada to become United's new CEO, but making up for a lack of investment for almost 20
                        years under the Glazers will take time.
                        <br /><br />
                        While there is optimism within the club, and among supporters, that Ratcliffe can act as the
                        catalyst for a renaissance at United, the reality is that problems run deep at Old Trafford.
                        <br /><br />
                        ESPN interviewed 15 people -- United staff members, past and present, from all areas of the club
                        -- to gain a clear picture of the club's decline and where things stand now. Their identities
                        have not been disclosed at their request. Manchester United declined to comment for this story.
                        <br /><br />
                        It is a story of waste, mismanagement, plunging morale and, at times, the bizarre. A story of
                        staff being diverted from key roles to attend to the needs of the Glazers and their close
                        family, of players being signed or rejected because of their commercial value and of Old
                        Trafford being painted the wrong shade of red.

                        that they messaged him shortly afterward but that they are still waiting for a reply.

                        "David Gill knew everybody at Old Trafford and you would often see him in the staff canteen," a
                        staff member said. "You never saw Ed and he certainly didn't know everybody. He spent most of
                        his time in the London office."

                        Meanwhile, transfer windows came and went with the club making expensive mistakes with the
                        Glazers and Woodward failing to oversee a coherent recruitment strategy.
                        <br /><br />
                        "[Manager] Jose Mourinho wanted to sign [winger] Ivan Perisic from Inter Milan in 2017, but was
                        told by Ed that, as a player, he wasn't commercially viable," a former United player told ESPN.
                        Woodward has told ESPN that no signing was vetoed for commercial reasons, saying "That was never
                        a consideration."
                        <br /><br />
                        "After that World Cup," the former United player continued, "Jose told Ed and the Glazers that
                        he wanted to get rid of Anthony Martial, that he was neither good enough nor reliable enough.
                        That was vetoed by the Glazers -- Joel was a big fan of Martial [as a player]."
                        <br /><br />
                        Six years later, Martial remains a United player and has scored 39 Premier League goals in 123
                        appearances. The 28-year-old becomes a free agent this summer and United sources have said
                        Martial will not be given a new contract.
                        <br /><br />
                        The failure to support a manager's judgment continued during Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's three-year
                        period in charge when United failed to seal deals for Erling Haaland, Jude Bellingham and Declan
                        Rice before they all became top, young stars.
                        <br /><br />
                        "Ole wanted to bring down the age of the squad, so he identified three young players and told
                        the club they should prioritize signing them," a former United teammate of Solskjaer told ESPN.
                        "United messed up moves for Haaland and Bellingham and didn't even make an effort for Rice. But
                        they did sign Donny van de Beek, despite him not even being a player that Ole had identified as
                        a target."
                        <br /><br />
                        German club Borussia Dortmund beat United to the signings of both Haaland and Bellingham, with
                        the two players since making big moves to City and Real Madrid, respectively. Rice joined
                        Arsenal for £105m last summer and has become a key figure in Mikel Arteta's team. Van de Beek is
                        now on loan at Eintracht Frankfurt -- he spent six months on loan at Everton in 2022 -- after
                        two goals in 62 appearances for United since a £40m transfer from Ajax in 2020.
